GestureVLC uses computer vision techniques to interpret hand gestures and control VLC Media Player. Utilizing OpenCV for image processing and cvzone for hand detection, it provides an intuitive, hands-free way to interact with your media player.


## Features

- **Real-time Gesture Detection**: The system detects hand gestures in real-time using your webcam.
- **Seamless VLC Integration**: Sends corresponding key presses to VLC Media Player based on detected gestures.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface with simple hand gestures for common media controls.
